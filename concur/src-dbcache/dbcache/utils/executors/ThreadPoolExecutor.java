/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each <tt>ThreadPoolExecutor</tt> also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A <tt>ThreadPoolExecutor</tt> will automatically adjust the
 * pool size
 * (see {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by corePoolSize
 * (see {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#getCorePoolSize})
 * and
 * maximumPoolSize
 * (see {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#getMaximumPoolSize}).
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#execute}, and fewer than corePoolSize threads
 * are running, a new thread is created to handle the request, even if
 * other worker threads are idle.  If there are more than
 * corePoolSize but less than maximumPoolSize threads running, a new
 * thread will be created only if the queue is full.  By setting
 * corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize the same, you create a fixed-size
 * thread pool. By setting maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded
 * value such as <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt>, you allow the pool to
 * accommodate an arbitrary number of concurrent tasks. Most typically,
 * core and maximum pool sizes are set only upon construction, but they
 * may also be changed dynamically using {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd> By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#prestartCoreThread} or
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#prestartAllCoreThreads}.
 * You probably want to prestart threads if you construct the
 * pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory}.  If not otherwise specified, a
 * {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is used, that creates threads to all
 * be in the same {@link ThreadGroup} and with the same
 * <tt>NORM_PRIORITY</tt> priority and non-daemon status. By supplying
 * a different ThreadFactory, you can alter the thread's name, thread
 * group, priority, daemon status, etc. If a <tt>ThreadFactory</tt> fails to create
 * a thread when asked by returning null from <tt>newThread</tt>,
 * the executor will continue, but might
 * not be able to execute any tasks. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#getKeepAliveTime}). This provides a means of
 * reducing resource consumption when the pool is not being actively
 * used. If the pool becomes more active later, new threads will be
 * constructed. This parameter can also be changed dynamically using
 * method {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#setKeepAliveTime}. Using a value
 * of <tt>Long.MAX_VALUE</tt> {@link TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively
 * disables idle threads from ever terminating prior to shut down. By
 * default, the keep-alive policy applies only when there are more
 * than corePoolSizeThreads. But method {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to apply
 * this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as
 * the keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.</li>
 *
 * <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>
 *
 * <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd> New tasks submitted in method {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#execute} will be <em>rejected</em> when the
 * Executor has been shut down, and also when the Executor uses finite
 * bounds for both maximum threads and work queue capacity, and is
 * saturated.  In either case, the <tt>execute</tt> method invokes the
 * {@link RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution} method of its
 * {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler policies
 * are provided:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> In the
 * default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the handler throws a
 * runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon rejection. </li>
 *
 * <li> In {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread that invokes
 * <tt>execute</tt> itself runs the task. This provides a simple
 * feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that new
 * tasks are submitted. </li>
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy},
 * a task that cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
 *
 * <li>In {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the executor is not
 * shut down, the task at the head of the work queue is dropped, and
 * then execution is retried (which can fail again, causing this to be
 * repeated.) </li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class provides <tt>protected</tt> overridable {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#beforeExecute} and {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#afterExecute} methods that are called before and
 * after execution of each task.  These can be used to manipulate the
 * execution environment; for example, reinitializing ThreadLocals,
 * gathering statistics, or adding log entries. Additionally, method
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 *
 * <p>If hook or callback methods throw
 * exceptions, internal worker threads may in turn fail and
 * abruptly terminate.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd> Method {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#getQueue} allows access to
 * the work queue for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of
 * this method for any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two
 * supplied methods, {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#remove} and {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#purge} are available to assist in storage
 * reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks become
 * cancelled.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd> A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be <tt>shutdown</tt>
 * automatically. If you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools
 * are reclaimed even if users forget to call {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#shutdown}, then you must arrange that unused
 * threads eventually die, by setting appropriate keep-alive times,
 * using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or setting {@link
 * ThreadPoolExecutor#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd> </dl>
 *
 * <p> <b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = true;
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void resume() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = false;
 *       unpaused.signalAll();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>

     * Support for execute().
     *
     * Method execute() and its helper methods handle the various
     * cases encountered when new tasks are submitted.  The main
     * execute() method proceeds in 3 steps:
     *
     * 1. If it appears that fewer than corePoolSize threads are
     * running, try to start a new thread with the given command as
     * its first task.  The check here errs on the side of caution.
     * The call to addIfUnderCorePoolSize rechecks runState and pool
     * size under lock (they change only under lock) so prevents false
     * alarms that would add threads when it shouldn't, but may also
     * fail to add them when they should. This is compensated within
     * the following steps.
     *
     * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we are done, but
     * still need to compensate for missing the fact that we should
     * have added a thread (because existing ones died) or that
     * shutdown occurred since entry into this method. So we recheck
     * state and if necessary (in ensureQueuedTaskHandled) roll back
     * the enqueuing if shut down, or start a new thread if there are
     * none.
     *
     * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
     * thread. There's no guesswork here (addIfUnderMaximumPoolSize)
     * since it is performed under lock.  If it fails, we know we are
     * shut down or saturated.
     *
     * The reason for taking this overall approach is to normally
     * avoid holding mainLock during this method, which would be a
     * serious scalability bottleneck.  After warmup, almost all calls
     * take step 2 in a way that entails no locking.
